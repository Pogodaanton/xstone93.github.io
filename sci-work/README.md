# Introduction to Scientific Working

*Introduction to Scientific Working* is an important course in many university-level programs and should support students to get into research. This website is based on the (same-named) course at Graz University of Technology for bachelor's students in various computer science programs. Since the learning objectives and guidances within this course share some common principles in scientific working, the website should serve as a starting point for all students who are at the beginning of their research. 

Currently, the course consists of three blocks. The first block can be completed entirely self-paced and asynchronously. Blocks 2 and 3 are the synchronous elements of the course that follow a flipped classroom approach. For each of both blocks, there will be a one-hour workshop where students present their findings. All learning resources are available here, which means that you can also get some guidance even though you are not currently in the course. All students within the course will also be provided with a semester schedule including all deadlines for the assignments. 

If you have additional questions, do not hesitate to contact me by email (alexander.steinmaurer@tugraz.at).
