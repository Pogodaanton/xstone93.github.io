# Getting into a topic 

First and foremost each research has a certain underlying question. 
One attribute that all passionate researchers share is curiosity. 
As researchers, we love to ask questions! 
But asking questions is just one part, we also want to find good answers. 
This sounds very pathetic, but you might ask yourself the following question now: 
*What is my question?*

This is already a good question. 
This question might open the floor for even more questions: 

* How do I come up with a good question? 
* What is a question that is worth answering? 
* Was this question already answered? 
* Is this question interesting at all? 

Coming up with a good question can be pretty hard at the beginning. 
This is something that takes some practice and requires a certain knowledge of the scientific field as well. 
However, you are usually not alone. Depending on your academic career your advisor will help you to come to a good question or at least give you some directions. 
I want to provide you with some advice:

**Write your ideas down.** 
Usually, I come up with research ideas/questions and the weirdest situations. 
This can be on the bike, while taking a walk, or when taking a shower.
This means I have to write my ideas down as fast as I can. 
Most of the time I have an analog notebook with me that I use, but I also love using a tool such as Notion. 
Another advantage of writing it down is that you have to find words. 
Ideas might come up as rough concepts, if you write them down with your own words you have to structure them and be more concrete, this helps. 
When you read your notes after a while you might see things differently, and add your new thoughts and ideas, in this way, your idea develops. 
Another tool that I really love to grow an idea is the good old Whiteboard. 
I don’t clean it as long as I am happy with an initial idea. 
By having everything on my Whiteboard I subconsciously see my notes in different situations and think about the idea and add things. 

**Talk to people.**
A common mistake is that people do not talk about their ideas. 
This has several reasons. Sharing an idea makes it attackable. 
You share your thoughts and might be anxious that people do not like it. 
Or even the opposite, people like the idea so much that they will take it. 
I can promise you: Both things will very likely not happen. 
I always enjoyed to share my ideas with other people. 
It helps me to get a better idea of what I want to do. 
I got valuable feedback and have interesting discussions. 
Try to find people that are honest and that you have trust in. 
I always enjoy talking to my colleagues first and as soon as I have a broad idea with my supervisor. 

**Do your homework.**
Research is about staying up to date. 
This requires a lot of reading. 
Unfortunately this is a typical problem when starting with research. 
It requires to actually dive into a topic. 
What I learned when working with students in computer science is that they really struggle with this.
The cool thing in computer science is that we tend to start with programming even though we don’t have an idea what we want to do. 
Don’t follow this bottom-up approach this is a bad idea, trust me!
I am absolutely sure that you are a good software developer, but research is not (just) about being a good software developer. 
We want to conduct good research and good research means that we have to get a comprehensive conceptual background and find meaningful related work first. 
The coolest tool is useless when there is already a ton of research about it and trust me, just thinking “This sounds like a novel idea, there is no research out” is a terrible idea.
