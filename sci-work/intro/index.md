# Introduction

You first might ask yourself how the process of writing a Bachelor's or Master's might be. 
For this reason, we visualized the process for both [Bachelor's](https://codislabgraz.org/resources/CoDiS-Bakk-theses.pdf) and [Master's](https://codislabgraz.org/resources/CoDiS-MA-theses.pdf) thesis in two roadmaps. 
You might realize that the basic structure of both is quite similar, and they are organized in different phases and iterations. 
We usually follow an iterative/agile approach when supervising. 
Why are we doing that? 
The answer is quite simple: We are satisfied with your work when you are satisfied with your work. This requires some back and forth and feedback, especially in the critical phases. 

You probably have also seen that *Scientific Start* is a dedicated phase in both roadmaps. 
This phase is the _most critical_ phase! Within this phase, you will define your focus and research question and plan your thesis/project.
Especially during this phase, regular meetings and workshops are crucial so you will not lose track (and I promise you, you might be overwhelmed at the beginning, this is normal when starting with a new project!)

Tons of books, tutorials, videos, etc. give you perfect introductions to scientific working/writing. 
There are many that I can highly suggest, and I really enjoyed reading them. I am absolutely convinced that these books, parallel to writing your thesis, solve so many problems before they show up. 
However, I am realistic enough to know that just a small number of students would actually do that (even though it would really help to get the correct mindset of scientific work). 
For this reason, I tried to make a short YouTube video covering the most necessary basics (!) about this topic.
Make sure you watch this video since it is a preparation for the upcoming blocks. We **expect** you to have watched the video.
