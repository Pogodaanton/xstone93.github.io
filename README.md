## Research Blog

Hi, I am Alexander Steinmaurer, a researcher and lecturer at the [Cognitive and Digital Science Lab](https://codislabgraz.org/) at Graz University of Technology. I obtain a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [Faculty of Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering](https://csbme.tugraz.at/) at Graz University of Technology. 

During the fall semester of 2023, I am at Brown University as a Research Fellow. 

My research interests are mainly in the field of Computer Science Education. Here is a list of topics that I am interested in:

- **Engaging learning technologies** - Designing engaging and interactive learning experiences within digital learning environments. This not just includes the development of technologies but as important is to evaluate them in an educational setting. 
- **Curriculum design** - Designing dedicated curricula for different educational contexts and topics such as Data Science, Introduction to programming or computational thinking. 
- **LLMs in (CS) Education** - Meaningful (!) integration of large language models into educational contexts, such as individualizing learning experiences.
- **Game-based learning/Gamification** - From a broad perspective, game-based learning could be seen as an engaging learning technology. But GBL/gamification is more than "playing a game and learn". A well-considered design process, implementation, and evaluation is necessary for both the tool and the teaching context.
- **Educational Data Analysis** - Analysis of educational data (qualitative and quantitative) retrieved from a real-life context such as courses, workshops, learning technology, etc.
- ***Large-scale Teaching** - Evaluation of students' learning experiences within a large-scale teaching and learning context.

## Courses
During my academic carrier, I had the opportunity to hold a lot of different lectures and courses, including:

- **Introduction to Programming** - This course is offered as a first-semester course (winter semester) at TU Graz and is an introduction to programming using the C programming language. Around 800 students from different study programs participate in this lecture and practical lab each year. \[Winter Semester 2020/21, 2021/22, 2022/23, and 2023/24\]
- **Object-oriented Programming 1** - This follow-up course on *Introduction to Programming* is a second-semester course where students learn the fundamentals of object-oriented programming using C++. \[Summer Semester 2021, 2022, 2023\]
- **Project Management** - This is a mandatory course in the Bachelor's program of software engineering and management at Graz University of Technology. Students learn about the fundamentals of project management when working on an actual project in teams of four. \[Summer Semester 2021, 2022, 2023\]
- **Introduction to Scientific Working** - This course is mandatory for TU Graz students that want to write their Bachelor's thesis. It is held each semester. 
- **Engaging Learning Technologies** - In this interdisciplinary elective course, students learn about the development of learning technologies and educational scenarios while evaluating their projects in real school classes. \[Winter Semester 2020/21, 2021/22, 2022/23, and 2023/24\]
- **Development of Multimedia Systems** (previously Multimedia Systems 2) - This seminar is part of the Master's program *Media Informatics and Digital Media Education* at the University College of Teacher Education Styria. It covers different topics related to multimedia systems, such as educational system design, game-based learning, evaluation, web development, etc. \[Summer Semester 2021, 2022, [2023](https://xstone93.github.io/courses/MIM2_23.html)\]
- **Markup Languages** - This four-semester course is part of the Business Software Development program of FH Campus 02 (University of Applied Sciences). It covers the fundamentals of markup languages (HTML, XML, XSD, XPath) but also covers micro-services and interface design (REST, JSON). \[Summer Semester 2021, 2022\]
- **Operating Systems** - This first-semester course at the Business Data Science program of FH Campus 02 covers the basics of operating systems. The students worked on concepts such as process management, memory management, I/O devices, Bash programming, and computer architecture. \[Winter Semester 2020/21, 2021/22\]

## Supervising 
I also had the honor to work with talented Bachelor and Master students and (co-)supervise their thesis:

**Master Students**
- David Kerschbaumer (2023) - *The Code to Success: Developing a Student Source Code Analysis Tool to Predict Course Performance and Identify Key Concepts in Programming Education*
- Michael Umfahrer (2023) - *Development and Implementation of SMAwT - An Online Learning Module to foster Social Media Literacy*
- Martin Sackl (2021) - *Improving Human-Computer Interactions in a Game-Based Learning Environment*
- Anil Kumar Tilanthe (2021) - *Development of a Learning Analytics Application for a Coding Learning Game*

# Research 
If you are interested in my research and want to talk about your ideas for Bachelor' or Master's thesis, I would love to hear from you - just drop me an email (alexander.steinmaurer@tugraz.at). 

[Here](https://xstone93.github.io/sci-work/#/) I also try to collect some useful resources and give you some advice. Make sure to check this page; It explains the different stages of research projects (as part of a thesis).
